I'm an Algorithm Engineer, living in Hefei📍. This is my personal tech blog where I share insights on programming practice, engineering implementation, and algorithm comprehension💻. 
Over the past few years, I’ve been engaged in autonomous driving, robot <a href="https://github.com/ZYCheng1002/Awesome-SLAM-and-3D-Reconstruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SLAM</a>, as well as robot <a href="https://github.com/ZYCheng1002/Awesome-Embodied-MLLMs-VLA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VLM/VLA</a> research🤖. I keep a record of my technical career here primarily to remind myself never to forget the knowledge accumulated along the learning journey, and to solidify my understanding through constant sorting and sharing📝. 

If you have a question about me or else, just send a letter to me📧.
